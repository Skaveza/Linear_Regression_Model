# Life Expectancy Prediction App

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to integrate **technology** and **healthcare** to empower individuals with data-driven insights for better decision-making.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**. It contains the following features:

| Life expectancy | Adult Mortality | Schooling | Total expenditure | BMI  |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|------|
| 65.0            | 263.0           | 10.1      | 8.16              | 19.1 |
| 59.9            | 271.0           | 10.0      | 8.18              | 18.6 |
| 59.9            | 268.0           | 9.9       | 8.13              | 18.1 |
| 59.5            | 272.0           | 9.8       | 8.52              | 17.6 |

The dataset has been preprocessed and analyzed. After testing three machine learning models, **Decision Tree** was found to be the most accurate and is used for predictions.

## Technologies Used
The app is built using:
- **Python** and **FastAPI** for the backend
- **Flutter** for the frontend
- **HTTP** for API requests

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Backend
